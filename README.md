# CuraInventorPlugin

## Credits:
Special thanks go to Chris Mitchell, the Autodesk community and Autodesk as a company itself.
By adding me to the feedback/beta program, they gave me the room to experiment with Autodesk Inventor.
As promised to Chris, this plugin is and will always be opensource and accessible for everyone.
This will be the case, as long as I am part of the feedback&beta program and be thus able to ensure maintainance and support.
